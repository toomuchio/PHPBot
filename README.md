# PHPBot
First thing I ever wrote in PHP, haven't touched the code in years.
 
Still comes in handy sometimes a very simple IRC Bot with SSL and multi-network support.
 
!raw <PHP CODE> = Runs the code, reports errors or return value, handy for testing preg_match
 
!die = Kills the bot
 
/include lets you put your scripts for any number of commands, the bot can reload these files on the fly without needing a restart.
 
Basicly a very simple Eggdrop implementation in PHP (Only this has SSL support unlike eggdrop ;P)
